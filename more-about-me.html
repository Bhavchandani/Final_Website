                        <p>Hey there, I’m Bhavana!</br>As you saw on the main page, my name means "cultivation" in Sanskrit and "emotion" in Hindi—so you could say I’m here to help you plant some seeds of inner peace and grow your own zen garden! I started my journey in India, mastering the art of Hatha yoga, but then I took a leap (or a graceful downward dog) to Denmark, where I discovered the powerful world of vinyasa and yin. That’s when I decided to deepen my practice with a 200-hour YTT in Rishikesh. Spoiler alert: it was less about finding enlightenment and more about perfecting my crow pose! <br></br>Fast forward to 2023, I found myself in Australia, ready to swap my yoga mat for a teaching role after six years of passionate practice. I completed my 300-hour YTT in Bali—because why not add a little tropical flair to my journey? Now, I’m thrilled to be sharing the mat at the Habitus Yoga Studio in Melbourne.<br></br>In my classes, expect a delightful mix of dynamic movements, breath awareness, and perhaps a few awkward giggles. I aim to create a warm, welcoming space where you can feel like a rock star on the mat—even if you’re channeling your inner pretzel!<br></br>When I’m not guiding you through asanas, you might find me exploring the ocean as a scuba diver, capturing the beauty of yoga through my lens, or planning my next wellness retreat (which I like to think of as yoga camp for adults!). I’m always on the lookout for new adventures—whether that’s hiking up a mountain or simply trying to keep my balance in a handstand.<br></br>So, let’s roll out those mats and dive into the transformative power of yoga together! Trust me, it’s way more fun than it sounds (and who knows, you might just discover your inner mermaid along the way)!
